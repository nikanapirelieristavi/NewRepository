        <h1>Inetersting facts</h1>
            <p>
                In the whimsical world of peculiar facts, did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have unearthed ancient pots <br>
                of honey in Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, <br>
                penguins could be excellent sommeliers, as they're known to enjoy the occasional sip of seawater. <br>
                Speaking of unusual preferences, the shortest war in history lasted just 38 to 45 minutes between Britain and Zanzibar in 1896. <br>
                In a cosmic twist, there's a planet named HD 189733b where it rains glass sideways due to ferocious 5400 mph winds. <br>
                Imagine a symphony of glass rain and penguin-inspired wine-tastingâ€”it's a delightfully odd world out there!
